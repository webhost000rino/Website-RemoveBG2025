Background Removal Algorithm
The aiRemoveBackground function is the core of the background removal feature, designed to handle any background color or pattern:

Edge Detection:

Uses a Sobel operator (threshold: 60) to identify foreground boundaries.
Detects edges based on intensity gradients for accurate subject separation.


Background Detection:

Combines multiple criteria:
Low color variance (<20–35) for uniform areas.
High brightness (>200
